# TN_PAD

This is a 4-key macropad case made for the Nashville Mech Keyboard Meetup on 8/27/2022. It is designed to snap together, but depending on your print settings, you may need to use the 2x m2 self-tapping scew holds to keep it together. Or you can glue it. There is no PCB, so you'll have to handwire it. 

## Print Settings

- Should print fine in any orientation. 
- No supports. 
- 15-25% Infill
